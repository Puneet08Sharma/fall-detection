Vision-Based Fall Detection System:
-----------------------------------
A vision-based fall detection system uses AI and computer vision to monitor people in real time and detect falls automatically.

 Why Vision-Based?

   Non-intrusive: No wearables required.
   Real-time: Instant alerts for faster response.
   Scalable: Works with existing CCTV infrastructure.

 Relevance
